Simplebuild - Universal Task Automation for Node.js
====================

Tools like [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) have powerful and flexible plugin ecosystems, but they only work within their walled garden. If you want to use Grunt plugins in [Jake](https://github.com/mde/jake), Jake tasks in Grunt, or write your own tool using an existing plugin... you're out of luck.

What if we had a universal approach to task automation? What if our task libraries worked with *any* tool, but our code was still idiomatic, flexible, and powerful? Imagine how useful that would be.

Simplebuild provides the solution. It's a standard way of *creating* and *plugging together* tasks that works with any tool. It's simple, but powerful; flexible, but idiomatic.

Note: Simplebuild is still in the proof-of-concept stage. Feedback welcome (be kind). Simplebuild is changing rapidly and shouldn't be used for production work yet.


Design Goals
-------

*Simple.* Simple to use, simple to create, and simple to extend.

*Replaceable.* No framework lock-in. You can use Simplebuild modules with any tool, and you can easily replace Simplebuild modules with something else.

*Flexible.* Works with multiple styles of automation (Grunt, Jake, promises, etc.) and allows you to compose modules to achieve interesting results.


Examples
-------

The following examples use Simplebuild modules to lint and test some code. Note how Simplebuild adapts to provide clean, idiomatic solutions for each tool.

(Note: these examples are slightly simplified. See [Gruntfile.js](Gruntfile.js), [Jakefile.js](Jakefile.js), or [build.js](build.js) for real code.)

### Grunt

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  var simplebuild = require("simplebuild-ext-gruntify.js")(grunt);

  grunt.initConfig({
    JSHint: {
      files: [ "**/*.js", "!node_modules/**/*" ],
      options: { node: true },
      globals: {}
    },

    Mocha: {
      files: [ "**/_*_test.js", "!node_modules/**/*" ]
    }
  });

  simplebuild.loadNpmTasks("simplebuild-jshint");
  simplebuild.loadNpmTasks("simplebuild-mocha");

  grunt.registerTask("default", "Lint and test", ["JSHint", "Mocha"]);
};
```

### Jake

```javascript
var jakeify = require("simplebuild-ext-jakeify.js").map;

var jshint = jakeify("simplebuild-jshint.js");
var mocha = jakeify("simplebuild-mocha.js");

task("default", ["lint", "test"]);

desc("Lint everything");
jshint.validate.task("lint", {
  files: [ "**/*.js", "!node_modules/**/*" ],
  options: { node: true },
  globals: {}
});

desc("Test everything");
mocha.runTests.task("test", [], {
  files: [ "**/_*_test.js", "!node_modules/**/*" ]
});
```

### Promises

```javascript
var promisify = require("simplebuild-ext-promisify.js").map;

var jshint = promisify("simplebuild-jshint.js");
var mocha = promisify("simplebuild-mocha.js");

jshint.validate({
  files: [ "**/*.js", "!node_modules/**/*" ],
  options: { node: true },
  globals: {}
})
.then(function() {
  return mocha.runTests({
    files: [ "**/_*_test.js", "!node_modules/**/*" ]
  });
})
.then(function() {
  console.log("\n\nOK");
})
.fail(function(message) {
  console.log("\n\nFAILED: " + message);
});
```

### Running the examples

Before running the examples:

1. Install Node.js
2. Download the project code
3. Open a command prompt in the project's root directory
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

To run the examples:

1. Run `node build.js`, `./grunt.sh`, or `./jake.sh`. (Windows users, use `node build.js`, `node_modules\.bin\grunt`, or `node_modules\.bin\jake`.)


Composability
-------

Simplebuild tasks can be used in any Node.js program, so it's easy to create tasks that depend on other tasks. If there's a module that does just what you need, no worries--just `require()` it and use it!

Simplebuild also supports "mapper modules" that change the way tasks run, and "extension modules" that interface with other tools. For example, the `simplebuild-map-header` module adds a header to tasks, and the `simplebuild-ext-promisify` module converts tasks into promises. Modules can be chained together, providing flexibility and power, without requiring any special programming in the tasks.

In this example, a single addition (the second line) to the "Promises" example above adds a header to all tasks:

```javascript
var promisify = require("simplebuild-ext-promisify.js")
  .map("simplebuild-map-header.js")
  .map;

var jshint = promisify("simplebuild-jshint");
var mocha = promsifiy("simplebuild-mocha");
...
```

Output:

```
Before:                         After:

Gruntfile.js ok                 JSHint
Jakefile.js ok                  ======
build.js ok                     Gruntfile.js ok
    ⋮                           Jakefile.js ok
								build.js ok
  ․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․               ⋮

  19 passing (44ms)             Mocha
                                =====

OK                                ․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․

                                  19 passing (44ms)


                                OK
```


How It Works
-------

Simplebuild's magic is based on standardized, composable function signatures and a very small supporting library. There are three kinds of Simplebuild modules:

* *Task modules* do the heavy lifting of task automation. For example, the `simplebuild-jshint` module uses JSHint to check files for errors. Task modules export functions that follow a standard format: `exports.taskFunction = function(options, successCallback, failureCallback) {...}`. This is the only requirement for Simplebuild tasks, other than some recommended documentation, so they're very easy to create.

* *Mapper modules* take a task module as input and provide a task module as output. (They can also convert other mapper modules, which allows them to be chained together.) They're programmed to provide a generally-useful improvement to task modules. For example, the `simplebuild-map-header` module adds a header to each task. The `createMapFunction()` call in the simplebuild library makes mapper modules easy to create.

* *Extension modules* are like mapper modules, except that they don't have any restrictions on their input or output. They're most often used for compatibility with other coding styles. For example, `simplebuild-ext-promsify` turns Simplebuild tasks into promises, and `simplebuild-ext-gruntify` loads Simplebuild modules into Grunt.


Creating Modules
------

For now, the easiest way to create a Simplebuild module is to copy one of the existing examples:

* Examples of task modules are in the [tasks/](tasks/) directory.

* Examples of mapper modules are in the [mappers/](mappers/) directory.

* Examples of extension modules are in the [stuff/](extensions/) directory. ...Nah, I'm just shitting you. They're in the [extensions/](extensions/) directory.

Eventually, the example modules will be released as standalone npm modules, but that's still in the future.


Contributions
-------

Contributions, feedback, and discussions are welcome. Please use Github's issue tracker to open issues or pull requests.

**Known issues**: This is still very experimental, proof-of-concept stuff. The core `simplebuild` library is likely to see a lot of changes, the spec is likely to change and improve, and there aren't any tests yet.


Formal Specification
-------
**[Stability](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index): 1 - Experimental**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this section are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Task Modules

Task modules export functions that follow a common format. A task module SHOULD have a name starting with "simplebuild-" but not "simplebuild-map-" or "simplebuild-ext-". (For example, "simplebuild-yourmodule.js".) All functions exported by a task module MUST be task functions.

Task functions MUST NOT be named `map()`, `sync()`, or use a name ending in `Sync()`. (These restrictions are case-sensitive.) Any other name is permitted. Each task function MUST conform to this signature:

    exports.yourFunction = function(options, success, failure) { ... }

`options` (REQUIRED): Configuration information. Any type of variable may be used, but an object is recommended. Each exported function MAY use this variable to determine what to do.

`success()` (REQUIRED): Callback function. Each exported function MUST call success() with no parameters when it finishes successfully.

`failure(messageString)` (REQUIRED): Callback function. Each exported function MUST call failure() with a brief human-readable explanation when it fails. The explanation SHOULD be less than 50 characters.

Each task function SHOULD also have descriptors attached, as follows:

    exports.yourFunction.title = "Your Name";
    exports.yourFunction.description = "Your description of the module."
    exports.yourFunction.options = { ... }  // TBD
    exports.yourFunction.defaults = { ... }  // TBD

`title`: A human-readable name for the function. It SHOULD be written in title case. It SHOULD be less than 22 characters.

`description`: A human-readable description of the function. It SHOULD be written as a single sentence, starting with a capital letter and ending with a period. It SHOULD be less than 50 characters.

`options`: (to be defined -- human-readable description of options)

`defaults`: (to be defined -- defaults used when an option is left blank)

#### Task Behavior

Task functions MUST NOT return values or throw exceptions. Instead, either the `success()` or `failure()` callback MUST be called exactly once when the task is complete. The callback MAY be called synchronously or asynchronously.

Tasks that fail SHOULD provide a detailed explanation suitable for debugging the problem. If the explanation is too long to fit in the 50-character failure mesage, the task SHOULD write the details to `process.stdout` before failing. (Note that calling `console.log()` is a convenient way of writing to `process.stdout`.)

Tasks that succeed SHOULD NOT write to `process.stdout` by default. They MAY write more if configured to do so with the `options` parameter.

Tasks that are slow or long-running MAY provide minimalistic progress output (such as periods) but SHOULD NOT provide more detailed information by default. They MAY write more if configured to do so with the `options` parameter.

Tasks SHOULD NOT write to `process.stderr` under any circumstances.


### Mapper Modules

Mapper modules export a single function, `map()`, that transforms a Simplebuild module in some way. A mapper module SHOULD have a name starting with `simplebuild-map-`. (For example, `simplebuild-map-yourmapper.js`.)

Mapper modules SHOULD use the `createMapFunction()` API call, defined in the `simplebuild` module, to create the `map()` function. Mapper modules MUST export only one function, named `map()`. The `map()` function call itself SHOULD NOT have any side effects, but the functions `map()` returns MAY have side effects.

The `map()` function MUST take a single parameter and return an object, as follows. These requirements are handled automatically by `createMapFunction()`.

* When the parameter is an object with a single key named `map`, it will be considered to be a mapper module. In this case, the `map()` function MUST return a mapper module. The returned module's `map()` function MUST wrap the provided mapper module so that calling `thisModule.map(providedModule).map(taskModule)` is equivalent to calling `thisModule.map(providedModule.map(taskModule))`

* When the parameter is any other object, it will be considered to be a task module. In this case, the `map()` function MUST return a task module object. The returned task module SHOULD have different functions and/or behavior than the provided task module.

* When the parameter is a string, it will be considered to be an npm module. In this case, the `map()` function MUST use the Node.js `require()` API call to load the module, then apply the above rules.


### Extension Modules

Extension modules extend the capabilities of Simplebuild. An extension module SHOULD have a name starting with "simplebuild-ext-" (for example, "simplebuild-ext-yourextension.js").

Extension modules MAY export any number of functions with any signature. Exported functions MAY do anything, including accepting other Simplebuild modules as parameters. When a function supports loading task modules by name, it SHOULD also support mapper modules as well. The `createMapFunction` API call defined in the `simplebuild` module may be helpful here.


To Do
-----
Things that still need work:

- When creating a module, the options and parameters need a lot of checking. Writing tests for this behavior is particularly tedious and repetitive.
